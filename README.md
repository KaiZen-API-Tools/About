# Introducing KaiZen OpenAPI Toolkit

KaiZen OpenAPI Toolkit is a high-performance Java stack for [OpenAPI](http://rzen.io/oas3spec), from [RepreZen](https://www.reprezen.com).

KaiZen includes the following projects:
* [KaiZen OpenAPI Editor](https://github.com/reprezen/kaizen-openapi-editor) - Feature-rich Eclipse editor for the industry-standard OpenAPI description language, formerly known as Swagger.
* [KaiZen OpenAPI Parser](https://github.com/reprezen/kaizen-openapi-parser) - High-performance Parser, Validator, and Java Object Model for OpenAPI.
* [KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer](https://github.com/reprezen/kaizen-openapi-normalizer) - Consolidates and simplifies multi-file OpenAPI projects to a single document for easy, reliable downstream code generation and presentation in Swagger UI or other API documentation formats.

**Note:** The KaiZen Editor and Parser are in the [RepreZen](https://github.com/reprezen) organization on GitHub, but will be moved into [KaiZen-API-Tools](https://github.com/kaizen-api-tools). This project is a placeholder.

## Related Projects

RepreZen also maintains other open source projects that are not exclusively focused on OpenAPI, but provide additional functionality or foundational support for KaiZen OpenAPI Toolkit:

* [GenFlow](https://github.com/RepreZen/GenFlow) is a comprehensive API code generation framework that supports a wide variety of code generation scenarios. 
* [JSON Overlay](https://github.com/reprezen/jsonoverlay) is a framework for creating a Java Parser and read/write API for any JSON (or YAML) based language.
